# London Bike Rides
This project is from a sample projects of Mo Chen on Youtube. The original of this project can be found from here [main GitHub repo](https://github.com/mochen862/LondonBikeRides).

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to predict future bike shares. The data is interpreted with a variety of parameter such as season, day, time, weather, etc...

### Methods Used
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling

### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas
* Tableau 

## Project Description
The project visualized amount of bike sharing based on time and weather from 01/2014 to 01/2017. From these visual, one can predicts amount of bike share in the future.

## Needs of this project

- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- statistical modeling
- writeup/reporting
- data visuallization

## Metadata

Metadata:

"timestamp" - timestamp field for grouping the data
"cnt" - the count of a new bike shares
"t1" - real temperature in C
"t2" - temperature in C "feels like"
"hum" - humidity in percentage
"wind_speed" - wind speed in km/h
"weather_code" - category of the weather
